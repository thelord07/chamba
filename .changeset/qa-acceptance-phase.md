Add an acceptance-QA phase: a `qa` agent that validates a ticket's acceptance criteria against the running app.

- New configurable `qa` role (`@chamba/core`): default `claude-opus-4-7` / high effort. It shows up in `config show`, the wizard, and `chamba_get_agent_config` automatically.
- The **planner** now emits a `## QA plan` for user-facing tickets — local seed, test users, URLs, login steps, and the expected behaviour per acceptance criterion. `validatePlan` warns (`missing-qa-plan`, non-blocking) when a user-facing plan lacks one.
- New **qa** subagent: it adapts to the project — if the repo has Playwright/Cypress (or a browser MCP) it drives the browser; otherwise it runs the repos from the worktree, applies the local seed, and co-pilots with you (asks you to log in, tells you what to click) while validating each criterion. Reports PASS/FAIL, never commits.
- `/ticket` runs the QA phase after verify when the plan has a `## QA plan`, and folds PASS/FAIL into the final acceptance-criteria checklist. New standalone `/qa <ticket>` command to run or re-run QA on its own.
