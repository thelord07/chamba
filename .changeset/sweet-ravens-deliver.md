Catch dead code after deletions and stop the /ticket flow from silently dropping acceptance criteria.

- `validatePlan` now warns (`deletion-without-orphan-check`) when a plan removes code but never mentions verifying referential closure — orphaned callers or now-unused exports. Heuristic, no LLM, no code-graph: it just routes deletion plans toward the build/typecheck + dead-code check (knip / ts-prune) instead of a token grep that misses orphans whose name doesn't contain the deleted symbol.
- The `/ticket` command gained a post-implementation **verify** stage: the reviewer subagent audits the real diff (not the plan) for referential closure, and the repo's build / typecheck / lint / dead-code check runs before reporting.
- `/ticket` autonomy is now bounded by the plan's own gates: items the plan marks `needs-approval` are never acted on autonomously, and the final report must include an acceptance-criteria checklist plus a "Needs your decision" section — an AC can no longer be silently dropped under "run to the end".
- The reviewer subagent's diff review now explicitly checks backward orphans (dead exports/helpers left by a deletion), not just forward breakage.
